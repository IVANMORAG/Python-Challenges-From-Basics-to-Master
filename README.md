# Python Exercises: From Basics to Advanced

## Overview
This repository contains 100 Python exercises designed to strengthen your understanding of Python, ranging from basic syntax to advanced topics like functions and algorithms. The exercises are categorized into three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**, and aim to simulate real-world challenges similar to those found on platforms like HackerRank.
